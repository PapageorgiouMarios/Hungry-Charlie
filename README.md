The original Snake game was created in 1997. It was played on Nokia devices and became one of the most famous games during the early days of mobile phones. 

The game was simple yet addictive â€“ players controlled a snake that grew longer as it ate food while avoiding running into the walls or its own tail.

This very game was the inspiration for this project.

Charlie is a friendly snake who tries to remain healthy by eating fruits! 

Player controls:
- Navigate menu options: UP/DOWN Arrow
- Select from menu: ENTER/SPACE
- Snake movements: UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT Arrow

The game was created in PyCharm with Python programming language and Pygame library.

The images of the snake skins and the apple were edited by the free online sprite editor Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/)


Here are some screenshots from the game itself:
